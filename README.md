# test_case_by_Pomidor
Task from YT-channel [Senior Pomidor Developer](https://www.youtube.com/@SeniorPomidorDeveloper).
Iâ€™m doing a test case that was given to him at some interview.
I watched 2 minutes of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VESgMTzFtKg&lc=UgyCBFkEJ5TJqw0v4wt4AaABAg.9woJ3pLyaxqA1eMMVUbLCl) video and paused it so I could do the task myself.

The goal is to run the `test.py` and get "done".
You can't change the `test.py`, but you can do everything to pass the test.
